    <description>OpenProtocolInterpreter is a library that converts the ugly package that came from Open Protocol TCP/IP or Serial, which is commonly called MID, to an object</description>
    <releaseNotes>
        1. Namespace "MIDs" removed, for more clean usings;
        2. Classes, methods and properties names changed (For example: MidIdentifier => MidInterpreter);
        3. All revisions added to all current Mids;
        4. Mid classes names changed from "MID_{number}" to "Mid{number}";
        5. All interfaces from Mids were made public, so now anyone can inject a custom mid to MidInterpreter;
        6. Enums moved to root namespace instead of each class having his own enum correspondent to their values;
        7. Converting does not work as before, it will convert it's value only when you trigger get, parsing became faster;
        8. DataValues cache get values for better performance;
        9. Parsing almost 50% faster than version 1.0.0.
